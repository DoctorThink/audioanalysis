# Audio Analysis Tool

## Overview

This audio analysis tool is a Python-based application designed to perform various audio signal processing and analysis tasks. It provides a comprehensive set of features for analyzing audio files, extracting meaningful features, and visualizing audio data.

## Features

* Spectral analysis of audio files
* Waveform visualization
* Beat detection and tempo analysis
* Frequency spectrum analysis
* Audio feature extraction (MFCC, spectral centroid, etc.)
* Real-time audio processing capabilities
* Export analysis results in various formats

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* `pip` package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DoctorThink/audioanalysis.git
   cd audioanalysis
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from audioanalysis import AudioAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = AudioAnalyzer()

# Load audio file
analyzer.load_audio("path/to/your/audio.wav")

# Perform analysis
features = analyzer.extract_features()
spectrum = analyzer.get_spectrum()
tempo = analyzer.detect_tempo()
```

### Example Scripts

The repository includes several example scripts demonstrating different analysis capabilities:

* `spectral_analysis.py`: Perform spectral analysis of audio files
* `beat_detection.py`: Detect beats and tempo in music
* `feature_extraction.py`: Extract various audio features


## Dependencies

* librosa
* numpy
* matplotlib
* soundfile
* scipy
* pandas (for data export)

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each module and function can be found in the `/docs` directory.

## Key Functions

* `analyze_audio()`: Performs comprehensive audio analysis
* `visualize_waveform()`: Generates waveform visualization
* `extract_features()`: Extracts audio features
* `detect_tempo()`: Analyzes tempo and rhythm

## Examples

```python
# Example of waveform visualization
analyzer.visualize_waveform(audio_file="sample.wav")

# Example of feature extraction
features = analyzer.extract_features(audio_file="sample.wav")
print(features)
```
